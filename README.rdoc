== Crawler

A simple web crawler written in ruby.  I wrote this as an exercise in writing terse ruby which is (hopefully) still readable.  It's not intended to fulfil a practical purpose

From the command line...

  ruby crawler.rb http://github.com 2

The first argument is the url to start crawling from.  The second argument is maximum depth to which the script should follow links - after all, we don't want to crawl the entire Web!
